# Calculator

## Description

Simple calculator program built using Python. This program was built to help me learn python syntax, test-driven development in python, python packages and python debugger.

## How to setup project on your computer

- In the terminal, enter the command `git clone https://github.com/JWKelly29/calculator.git`. This will create a copy of this project.
- In the terminal, enter the command `cd calculator`. This will change your directory to the project directory.
- In the terminal enter the command `brew install python`. This will install the latest version of python, pip and setup tools.

## How to use

- After completing initial setup...
- In the terminal, enter the command  `python`. This will open up the python interactive shell.
- In the terminal, interact with the program by first executing the app file `execfile('app/calculator.py')` and then creating an instance of a calculator `calc = Calculator()`
- In the terminal, perform addition, subtraction, multiply and divide operations by entering commands in this format `calc.add(2,2)`, `calc.subtract(2,2)`, `calc.multiply(2,2)`, `calc.divide(2,2)`.

## How to run TestCase

- After completing initial setup...
- In the terminal, install nosetests by entering the command `pip install nose`.
- In the terminal, enter the command `nosetests`.

## Challenges

- Understanding python packages. I used 'http://pythoncentral.io/how-to-create-a-python-package/' to help me overcome this challenge.
